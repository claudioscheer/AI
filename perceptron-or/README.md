# About

This is an example of a perceptron neural network that can learn how to deal with the OR operator. This neural network cannot handle XOR operator, because XOR cannot be expressed as a linear function like OR.

The neural network looks something like this (x0 is the bias = 1):

x0 |
x1 | --> perceptron
x2 |
