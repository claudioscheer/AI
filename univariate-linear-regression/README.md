The dataset is available at [https://www.kaggle.com/kennethjohn/housingprice](https://www.kaggle.com/kennethjohn/housingprice).

The dataset columns are: Size of the house (in square feet), Number of bedrooms, Price of the house.

In this example I only used the size of the house to predict the price of the house.
